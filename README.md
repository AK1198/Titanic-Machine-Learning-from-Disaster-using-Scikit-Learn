## 1. Introduction
This is the first project where I dive into ML competitions and familiarize with how the Kaggle platform works.he sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.In this project I build a predictive model to predict what sorts of people were more likely to survive.

## 2. Scikit Learn/sklearn

Scikit-learn is an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning. It also provides various tools for model fitting, data preprocessing, model selection and evaluation, and many other utilities.
+ Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis
+ Accessible to everybody, and reusable in various contexts
+ Built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib
+ Open source, commercially usable - BSD license

For this project I have used Logistic Regression model.And for the classification models the evaluation metrics is best represented in Confusion Matrix and also Precision,recall,f1-score and support.
